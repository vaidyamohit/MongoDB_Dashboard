# MongoDB_Dashboard

## Dataset Attributes
The dataset contains information about various countries, focusing on demographic and geographic metrics. Key attributes include:

**Country:** Name of the country.

**Population:** Total population in the country.

**Density per square km:** Number of people per square kilometer.

**Land area in square km:** Total land area in square kilometers.

**Fertility Rate:** Average number of children born per woman.

**Median Age:** Median age of the population.

**Net Change:** Change in population over a year.

**Migrants Net:** Net migration rate.

**Urban Population:** Percentage of the population living in urban areas.

**World Share:** Share of the world’s total population.


## Objectives

**Understand Global Demographics:** Analyze population distribution, density, and demographic trends across countries.
**Explore Fertility and Age Dynamics:** Investigate relationships between fertility rate, median age, and urbanization.
**Highlight Migratory Trends:** Examine net migration patterns and their impact on population changes.
**Identify Extremes:** Determine the least and most populated, dense, and urbanized countries.
**Provide Managerial Insights:** Support policymakers, demographers, and business leaders with data-driven insights.

## Managerial Insights

### Population Trends:
Countries like China and India dominate in terms of population​(world-population-by-cou…).
Fertility rates in countries with high populations (e.g., Nigeria, India) are higher than those in developed nations​.

### Density Analysis:
Urbanized countries like Singapore and Hong Kong have the highest population density.
Countries with vast land areas but low population density (e.g., Canada, Australia) could focus on urban development.

### Median Age vs. Fertility:
Developed countries with higher median ages (e.g., Japan, Germany) report lower fertility rates, signaling aging populations.
Countries in Africa (e.g., Niger, Mali) have younger populations and higher fertility rates​.

### Migration Patterns:
Countries like the U.S. and Germany show positive net migration, indicating their attractiveness for migration.
Negative migration rates in countries like Syria reflect political or economic instability​.

### Global Population Distribution:
Top 10 countries represent over half of the world’s population​.
Understanding urban population trends helps identify market opportunities for infrastructure, housing, and services.

### Fertility Rate Distribution:
High fertility in sub-Saharan Africa contrasts with declining rates in European and East Asian countries, affecting labor markets and economic growth.

### Correlation Analysis:
Fertility rate and population density do not have a direct relationship across all regions, indicating that other factors (economic, cultural) influence demographic patterns​.

### Policy Implications:
Aging populations in developed countries demand healthcare innovations and pension reforms.
High fertility rates in developing nations highlight the need for education, healthcare, and family planning programs.
